          This is so simple that it barely qualifies as a recipe, but it's a nice and nutritious meal that can be done in 20-30 minutes depending on your vegetable chopping skills. If you want to be fancy, you can also add some pomegranate seeds on top when serving. Really, you can add anything you like.
          <ol>
            <li>Finely chop the onion, carrot(s) and bell pepper.</li>
            <li>Prepare the couscous according to the package instructions.</li>
            <li>While your couscous is cooking, heat a small pan to medium high heat and add some olive oil. Fry up the onion, carrot(s) and bell pepper with some salt for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once they are fried to your liking, add the smoked paprika and fry for 2 minutes. Then take the pan off the heat.</li>
